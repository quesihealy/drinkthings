	<p>The purpose of this project is to provide a sample of my code. You can follow
		this project on Github <a href="https://github.com/quesihealy/drinkthings">here</a>.
		I also wanted to hook my friends up with a chance to play a blatant rip off of The Game
		of Things. We are often out at a bar and don't have any of the supplies.</p>

	<p>I'm not advertising or marketing this at all, but if you'd like this removed please
		contact me. I don't want trouble :)</p>

	<p>Otherwise, play on friends!</p>
