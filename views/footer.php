					Lucas Healy</a>, to provide a sample of my code. You can follow the project
					on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/quesihealy/drinkthings">here</a>. It is a 
					blatant copy of "The Game of Things." I know. I'm not trying to make money or
					advertise this thing though. Please contact me if you'd like it taken down.</span>
